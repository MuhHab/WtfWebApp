                        Puppet is all about automating the configuration and management of servers and the software running on them, whether
                        on physical or virtual machines, on-prem or in the cloud. They've also expanded to integrating with network devices,
                        and that's going to continue through their relationships with many data center hardware vendors.  It's all about
                        infrastructure as code, and so Puppet is used by everyone from startups to Google.

                        It doesn't matter how elegant your architecture is, how beautifully written your code is, or how many unit
                        tests you have if you can't reliably and repeatedly deploy changes to your applications.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Our products play an important role in this delivery process and help all kinds of code -- good, bad, old,
                        and new -- go safely on to production. And should bugs find their way in your code, we want to make sure
                        you can test and deploy fixes as fast as you can write them.
